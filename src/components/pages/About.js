				My name is Nam Truong and I am a freshman from the University of Texas at Dallas studying computer science. I created this site to not only 
                highlight my work and accomplishments but to exhibit my growth and development within computer science. Through my academic work, projects,
                and self interests, I have learned java, c++, ruby, and javascript as well as using git for version control.<br /><br />
                Currently, I am involved in the Association for Computing Machinery at UTD, participating in its 
                projects division and HackUTD.
                After participating in my first hackathon, I became a technical officer for HackUTD to help organize and enrich the experience of
                the many new students who decide to partake in HackUTD in the future. Additionally, I am involved in the UTD powerlifting team.<br /><br />
                When I'm not coding or learning, I enjoy weight training, playing games, testing my typing ability, and eating mint chocolate chip ice cream :)
